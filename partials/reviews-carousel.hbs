                            Really this is the best storage company Iâ€™ve found in NYC. Especially the customer service. Chantel was extremely helpful, friendly and professional and her customer support was 100% of the reason I decided to use local locker.

                            Hello - Glad this place opened up right on cortelyou. Very convenient access hours (accessible hours are much later than the other larger storage places i've looked at) and good customer service.

                            Local Locker is my fave. I've been a loyal customer since they first opened... and I never looked back. I own a few pieces from van Gogh that don't really suit my penthouse, so they're stored in a temperature-controlled unit at LL!

                            I've used 6 or 7 different storage companies in the past 10 years, and none of them compete with the folks at Local Locker. Their booking flow and customer support are flawless. Did I mention their website is also extremely fast?
